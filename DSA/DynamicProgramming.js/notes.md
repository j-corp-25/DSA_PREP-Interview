# Dynamic Programming

It doesnt mean anything specifically but its a technique to use when using some sort of cache

## What is caching?

It is way to store values to use them again later. We use this to speed up programs. Another term is memoizatiion

```javascript
const addTo80 = (n) => {
  return n + 80;
};

```
