There are Directed graphs and Undirected graphs


Directed:

Describing traffic flow, where movement is only in one directions

unDirected :
Think of a highway between two cities where you can go both ways in and out.

There is also Weighted and Unweigthed graphs.

Weighted:

Values can be applied to the edges between the connections. This is used to calculate optimal paths to certain locations. I.e fastest way to get to a number


There is also Cyclic and Acyclic

Cyclic graphs is when you can go from one node to another and back to the original one


Quiz:
