# Binary Search Trees

PROS & Cons

+ Better than O(0)
+ Ordered
+ Flexible Size

If it becomes an un-balance then it become linear O(n). One con is that it doesnt have O(1) operations.

Binary Search Trees run at O(log n)

There is also Binary Heaps which uses a priority queue and uses the least amount of space, It inserts from left to right so there is a form of order. It is very memory effiecient.
