# What is good code?

1.  Scalable

2.  Readability

When we grow bigger and bigger with the amount of input how much does the performance of the algorithm changes?

Does it slow down? Does it speed up?

__We can calculate it by counting the amount of operations in the algorithm that it has to go through__

This is linear time O(n) meaning that the more elements we have the more operations we would also have. So if we have 1000 elements of `n` would also perform 1000 operations
